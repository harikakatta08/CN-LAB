        "Network devices are essential components that enable communication between computers and other devices in a network. In a Local Area Network (LAN), various devices work together to ensure data transmission and connectivity. Below are some commonly used network devices and their functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tEssential Network Devices\n",
        "a)\tRouter:\n",
        "•\tFunction: Connects multiple networks and directs data packets to their destination.\n",
        "•\tFeatures: Dynamic routing, Network Address Translation (NAT), and firewall capabilities.\n",
        "•\tUse Case: Connecting a LAN to the internet.\n",
        "b)\tSwitch:\n",
        "•\tFunction: Connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data only to the intended recipient.\n",
        "•\tFeatures: VLAN support, MAC address learning, and high-speed data transfer.\n",
        "•\tUse Case: Interconnecting computers, printers, and servers within a network. c) Hub:\n",
        "•\tFunction: Broadcasts data to all connected devices without filtering.\n",
        "•\tFeatures: Simple, inexpensive, and basic connectivity.\n",
        "•\tUse Case: Small or less complex networks.\n",
        "d)\tModem (Modulator-Demodulator):\n",
        "•\tFunction: Converts digital signals to analog for transmission over phone lines and vice versa.\n",
